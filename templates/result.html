            <h2>Educational Equity Resources</h2>
            <p>Our project aims to spark discussions about potential disparities in education. The model, using fictional data, highlights how systemic issues might contribute to unequal educational opportunities across different demographics. The results serve as a reminder of the ongoing challenges in achieving equitable education for all.</p>
            <p>For a deeper understanding of these complex issues, we recommend the following resources:</p>

            <h2>Promoting Policy Change</h2>
            <p>While my model is an illustrative tool, it underscores the importance of using data to uncover and address educational disparities. We advocate for data-driven policy interventions to rectify inequities in educational systems. Though my model is a simplification, it brings to light crucial areas requiring attention and reform.</p>

            <h2>Call for Ethical Data Practices</h2>
            <p>I emphasize the critical need for ethical data practices in education. Transparency in data collection, model development, and the inclusion of diverse perspectives are essential. It is imperative to ensure that educational technologies and policies are developed responsibly, considering the multifaceted impact on various demographic groups.</p>
